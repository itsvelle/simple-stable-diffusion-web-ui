# Models

Put your local model assets here.

Suggested layout:

- models/base/   (SDXL base models: a Diffusers directory or a single .safetensors)
- models/refiner/ (optional SDXL refiner model)
- models/vae/    (VAE files or folders)
- models/lora/   (LoRA .safetensors)

This app will only scan within this folder.
